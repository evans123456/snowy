L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Richard, excellent job on your homework. Looking this over gives us both a much better idea of how to get you back on track in your life.
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Well, thanks.
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ One of our main goals for today is to talk about what your panic symptoms mean. Let’s start there.
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Okay. Sou
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ The first thing is that even though the intense panic feelings you’ve been getting seem strange, they’re completely natural. Humans are designed to experience panic just like you’ve been experiencing it. Why do you suppose that is?
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Um. I’ve always figured that when my heart starts pounding and I get dizzy and all that, it must mean that something is terribly wrong.
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Exactly! The human internal panic response is an alarm system. Some people call it the fight-or-flight response. When it’s working properly, the panic alarm is a great survival device. It increases blood pressure, tenses up muscles, and gets you ready to run or fight. It’s supposed to go off exclusively during moments of extreme danger—like when you’re crossing a street and a car is barreling straight at you, or when you’re attacked by a mugger. Your main problem is that your alarm is misfiring. It’s going off when you don’t need it. You’ve been having a series of false alarms. Think about that. When you’ve had your panic attacks, have there been any extreme dangers you’re facing?
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Not exactly. But when I start to feel panicked, I’m sure I must be having a heart attack, just like my dad did when he was my age.
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What have the doctors said about that?
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Well, they’ve told me my heart is fine. That it’s in good shape.
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ So the false alarm you’re feeling has two main parts. There are the physical symptoms of heart pounding, dizziness, shortness of breath, and tingly hands—that’s one part. And then there’s the thought of “I’m going to die from a heart attack just like my dad” that grabs you. And both these signals, the physical sensations and the thought you’re going to die, are false. There is no immediate big danger, and your heart is fine. Right?
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  That’s what they say.
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay, I know it feels incredibly scary and it’s a horrible feeling. I don’t expect you to instantly believe what I’m saying or what your doctor is saying, because the feelings are real and you’ve been having them repeatedly. But let’s Behavioral Theory and Therapy 245 take it a step further. What would happen if you were in a movie theater and a false alarm went off? What would happen if you just sat there, because you knew it was only a false alarm?
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  I—um, I think, uh, I’d get pretty freaked out sitting there if everybody else was rushing out.
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Perfect. So you’d feel some fear, but let’s say you just sat there anyway and felt your fear, but you recognize that it’s a false alarm and so you know that jumping up and running out isn’t necessary. What would eventually happen?
L1044 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  I guess your point is that the fear would eventually go away. Is that it?
L1045 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ That’s right. Just like we talked about during your intake interview, eventually your heart stops pounding and returns to normal, and the tingling sensations go away, and your body’s alarm shuts off and it returns to normal.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay, Richard, we’re about done for today, but of course I’ve got somehomework for you again. You did such a great job with the first set,This week I’d like you to slowly cutback on the caffeine intake. How do you think you might accomplish that?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ I suppose I can get some of that caffeine-free soda. Well, actually my wife already picked some up.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Excellent. So you’ve got an option waiting at home for you, and your wife is very supportive. And make that same switch to decaf coffee.
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Okay.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ And keep up your self-monitoring panic log. The more we know about the patterns and symptoms, the better our work together will go.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay, Richard, remember last week we talked about your panic symptoms being a natural, but false, alarm?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Yeah, I remember.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I got the impression that you weren’t totally convinced of that idea, so if you want, we can discuss it a bit further, do a brief demonstration, and then focus on a new breathing technique that will help you calm yourself.
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Yeah, I’m always a skeptic about everything. But I have to say I’m feeling a little better, and I think the no caffeine rule is helping.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I’m sure it is, because like we’ve talked about, caffeine produces some of the physical sensations that trigger a panic attack. When the caffeine hits your system and your heart rate and breathing increase just a little bit, you can’t help but notice it, and the false alarm can start that much easier.
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Yeah. That seems right to me.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What we want is for you to be able to turn off the false alarm.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay, that’s great. Now let’s have you try it for one minute.
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Okay. 
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Nice job, Richard. You had a slow and steady pace. How did it feel?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ It was fine. I felt a little uptight to start, but it got easier, smoother as I went along.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Excellent. Now I’m going to show you something that’s called overbreathing or hyperventilation. Watch. [Therapist stands up and breathes deeply and rapidly, as if trying to quickly blow up a balloon. After about 1 minute, he sits down and slows down his breathing again.] So, Richard, what did you see happening to me as I did the overbreathing?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ I don’t know what you felt like on the inside, but your face got red and when you sat down you looked a little unsteady.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Right. I intentionally hyperventilated and felt some of what you feel during a panic attack. I got dizzy and light-headed, and my hands felt tingly.When I sat down and did the diaphragmatic breathing I could actually feel my heartbeat slowing back down.
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ That’s pretty intense.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You can probably guess what’s next. I want you to try the same thing, and as soon as you start to feel any dizziness or heart pounding or any of the symptoms that bother you, I want you to sit down and do your diaphragmatic breathing until the feelings subside. Got it?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ I’m not so sure. How do you know I won’t have a full-blown attack?
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Actually, that’s a big part of this activity. If you have a full-blown attack, I’ll be here and guide you through the breathing and the symptoms will pass. Of course, our goal is for you to just feel a tiny bit of the symptoms and then sit down and relax and breathe. But even if it gets more extreme for you, we have plenty of time, so I’ll be here and you’ll get control back over your body. Ready?
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ Okay.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Now, Richard, tell me what you felt when overbreathing and what you’re feeling now.
L660 +++$+++ u3 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CHASTITY +++$+++ I’m okay now, but I did get dizzy. And my hands got tingly. It was amazingly similar to my attacks. But I’m okay now, maybe a little shaky, but okay.
L659 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ So you feel okay now. Actually, you look good too. And you gave your body an excellent lesson. Now your body is starting to know that the panic alarm can get turned on intentionally and that you can turn it back off yourself.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  I know it can be hard to believe that what and how you think can have such an amazing influence on your emotions, but it’s true. Let me give you an example.
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Okay.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  Let’s say you’re lying in bed at night, trying to go to sleep, and suddenly, out of nowhere, you hear a thud somewhere in your house. What would you feel?
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I’d probably be scared.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  Okay, so the first thing that comes to mind is that you’d feel scared. How about if you were taking care of a very pesky dog for a friend of yours,how would you feel then?
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Well, if I knew it was the dog being pesky, then I’d feel annoyed, I guess. Probably I’d feel irritated that the dog was making noise while I’m trying to sleep.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  Perfect. So you’ve demonstrated that it’s not the thud that produces your emotional reaction, but instead it’s what you think about the thud. Tell me, when you first said you’d probably be scared in reaction to the thud, what thoughts went through your mind that would lead to that feeling?
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I thought you were suggesting that the thud meant that a burglar had broken into my house, and then of course I’d be scared.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  Exactly. In the absence of information about what caused the thud, you inserted the possibility of a burglar, and that would, of course, produce fear. But if you think it’s a pesky dog, then you feel annoyed. And how about if your grandmother was staying at your house and you heard an unusual thud, what might come to mind then?
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I’d feel scared then too. Scared that she might have hurt herself. I’d get right up and go check on her.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  So now you’re telling me that what you think not only directly affects your emotions, but also your behavior, because if you thought it was a burglar then you probably wouldn’t jump up and check, you’d do something different, right?
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ That’s true.
L760 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++  So, my point is that it’s not the thud or what happens to you that produces your emotions and behavior, but instead, it’s what you think about a situation. It’s your assumption or belief about the situation that cause you to feel and act in particular ways.
L759 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, I see what you mean.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What is cognitive therapy?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Cognitive therapy is one of the few forms of psychotherapy that has been scientifically tested and found to be effective in over three hundred clinical trials for many different disorders. In contrast to other forms of psychotherapy, cognitive therapy is usually more focused on the present, more time-limited, and more problem-solving oriented. Indeed, much of what the patient does is solve current problems. In addition, patients learn specific skills that they can use for the rest of their lives. These skills involve identifying distorted thinking, modifying beliefs, relating to others in different ways, and changing behaviors.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What is the theory behind cognitive therapy?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which . . . simply [posits] that the way we perceive situations influences how we feel emotionally. For example, one person reading this [material] might think, “Wow! This sounds good, it’s just what I’ve always been looking for!” and feels happy. Another person reading this information might think, “Well, this sounds good but I don’t think I can do it.” This person feels sad and discouraged. So it is not a situation which directly affects how a person feels emotionally, but rather [it affects] his or her thoughts in that situation. When people are in distress, they often do not think clearly and their thoughts are distorted in some way. Cognitive therapy helps people to identify their distressing thoughts and to evaluate how realistic the thoughts are. Then they learn to change their distorted thinking. When they think more realistically, they feel better. The emphasis is also consistently on solving problems and initiating behavioral change.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What can I do to get ready for therapy?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ An important first step is to set goals. Ask yourself, “How would I like to be different by the end of therapy?” Think specifically about changes you’d like to make at work, at home, [and] in your relationships with family, friends, co-workers, and others. Think about what symptoms have been bothering you and which you’d like to decrease or eliminate. Think about other areas that would improve your life: pursuing spiritual/intellectual/cultural interests, increasing exercise, decreasing bad habits, learning new interpersonal skills, improving management skills at work or at home. The therapist will help you evaluate and refine these goals and help you determine which goals you might be able to work at on your own and which ones you might want to work on in therapy.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What happens during a typical therapy session?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Even before your therapy session begins, your therapist may have you fill out certain forms to assess your mood. Depression, Anxiety and Hopelessness Inventories help give you and the therapist an objective way of assessing your progress. One of the first things your therapist will do in the therapy session is to determine how you’ve been feeling this week, compared to other weeks. This is what we call a mood check. The therapist will ask you what problem you’d like to put on the agenda for that session and what happened during the previous week that was important. Then the therapist will make a bridge between the previous therapy session and this week’s therapy session by asking you what seemed important that you discussed during the past session, what self-help assignments you were able to do during the week, and whether there is anything about the therapy that you would like to see changed. Next, you and the therapist will discuss the problem or problems you put on the agenda and do a combination of problem-solving and assessing the accuracy of your thoughts and beliefs in that problematic situation. You will also learn new skills. You and the therapist will discuss how you can make best use of what you’ve learned during the session in the coming week and the therapist will summarize the important points of the session and ask you for feedback: what was helpful about the session, what was not, anything that bothered you, anything the therapist didn’t get right, anything you’d like to see changed. As you will see, both therapist and patient are quite active in this form of treatment.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ How long does therapy last?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Unless there are practical constraints, the decision about length of treatment is made cooperatively between therapist and patient. Often the therapist will have a rough idea after a session or two of how long it might take for you to reach the goals that you set at the first session. Some patients remain in therapy for just a brief time, six to eight sessions. Other patients who have had long-standing problems may choose to stay in therapy for many months. Initially, patients are seen once a week, unless they are in crisis. As soon as they are feeling better and seem ready to start tapering therapy, patient and therapist might agree to try therapy once every two weeks, then once every three weeks. This more gradual tapering of sessions allows you to practice the skills you’ve learned while [you are] still in therapy. Booster sessions are recommended three, six and twelve months after therapy has ended.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What about medication?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Cognitive therapists, being both practical and collaborative, can discuss the advantages and disadvantages of medication with you. Many patients are treated without medication at all. Some disorders, however, respond better to a combination of medication and cognitive therapy. If you are on medication, or would like to be on medication, you might want to discuss with your therapist whether you should have a psychiatric consultation with a specialist (a psychopharmacologist) to ensure that you are on the right kind and dosage of medication. If you are not on medication and do not want to be on medication, you and your therapist might assess, after four to six weeks, how much you’ve progressed and determine whether you might
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ How can I make the best use of therapy?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ One way is to ask your therapist how you might be able to supplement your psychotherapy with cognitive therapy readings, workbooks, client pamphlets, [and so on]. A second way is to prepare carefully for each session,thinking about what you learned in the previous session and jotting down what you want to discuss in the next session. A third way to maximize therapy is to make sure that you try to bring the therapy session into your everyday life. A good way of doing this is by taking notes at the end of each session or recording the session or a summary of the session on audiotape. Make sure that you and the therapist leave enough time in the therapy session to discuss what would be helpful for you to do during the coming week and try to predict what difficulties you might have in doing these assignments so your therapist can help you before you leave the session.
L1051 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ How will I know if therapy is working?
L1052 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Most patients notice a decrease in their symptoms within three to four weeks of therapy if they have been faithfully attending sessions and doing the suggested assignments between sessions on a daily basis. They also see the scores on their objective tests begin to drop within several weeks. This information is reproduced with permission from Judith S. Beck, Ph.D., director of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy and Research. You can find this information and more at the Institute’s web site: www.geocities.com/spiroll2/cbtexplained.html.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I see here on your panic logs that when you got separated from your wife, Linda, your mind started running a hundred miles an hour. Tell me about what you were thinking and feeling when you couldn’t find her.
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  She said she was just going to the restroom, and so I was browsing around by the restrooms, and I never saw her come out. I kept waiting and waiting, and it felt like forever. I got all worked up. Ever since this panic stuff started, she’s been like my shadow. When she didn’t come out I kept thinking that she must be hurt or sick or, my God, that maybe she was passed out or even dead. I finally got a woman to go in and check on her, and she wasn’t in there, and then my mind really started racing. I thought she’d left me. I was sure that she’d finally gotten sick and tired of dealing with me and had snuck away.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ So where was she?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Oh, I guess there was an elderly woman in the bathroom who had gotten confused, and Linda took her to the help desk and they asked a bunch of questions. She said she felt terrible about being gone so long, but she had to help this woman, and then the woman got frightened and didn’t want her to leave. I guess I must have wandered away a little ways when Linda came out with the woman, ’cause I never saw them at all.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ So then how did you and Linda get back together, and then what happened?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Linda found me in a cold sweat by the restrooms. I was trying to figure out why she would leave me and I was imagining life without her, and she came dashing up and started to explain everything, but I was in such a panic state I just had to go home. I couldn’t get myself to focus and breathe and calm down. I just had to go home to settle myself down. I’m sorry.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ It sounds like that was terribly frightening for you. There’s no need to apologize. Like we’ve talked about before, those false alarms you’ve been having aren’t going to go away all at once. You’ve been making great progress. What’s important is that we take a good hard look at what happened and learn from it so you can keep getting the upper hand on the panic.
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Yeah, I know. But I can’t help feeling like I disappointed myself, and you too.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Well, actually, I have to say you had what looks like an excellent week. You practiced the diaphragmatic breathing and used it to calm yourself. And the incident that happened with Linda is perfect for us to use to understand even more about what’s causing the panic.
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  You think so?
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Absolutely. The next item on today’s agenda is for us to talk about this thing we call “automatic thoughts.” As most people go through the day, they have things happen and then their minds quickly produce automatic thoughts about what just happened to them. When you were waiting for Linda and she didn’t come out, you immediately started thinking that something terrible was wrong. You said you thought she was hurt or sick or dead in the bathroom. Those are terribly stressful thoughts. And then, as soon as the woman went in there and told you the bathroom was empty, it sounds like your first thought was that Linda was so sick of you that she had up and left you. Is that right?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Yeah. That’s right.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay, now that you’re calm, I want to ask you some questions about what you were thinking in the store. Ready?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Yeah.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Has Linda ever gotten hurt or injured in a public restroom before?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  No. I know. That’s a crazy thing for me to think.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Actually, it’s not totally crazy, it’s just a big overestimation. Based on the fact that she’s in good health and the fact that this has never happened before in your history of being together makes the odds that she would get hurt in the bathroom very unlikely. You see what I’m saying, it’s possible, but very unlikely.
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Okay.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ And here are some more questions. Does Linda love you?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Yes. I’m sure of that.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ And has she ever said that she’s tired of being with you?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Nope.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ And were the two of you in a fight or having a bad time at the store?
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Oh no. We like to shop together. We always have fun going out shopping. We don’t always buy all that much, but we have a good time looking around.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Okay, so the thought that she’d up and left you is not really overestimating. It’s more like a catastrophic thought. Your automatic thought was of the worst possible relationship catastrophe—even though there was absolutely no evidence to support it. You and Linda have been together for thirty years. She says she loves you and is happy to be with you and you were having a good time, but somehow you assumed that she must be tired of you and therefore she had left you permanently.
L922 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Man. That does sound pretty crazy. You’re right. When we talk about this it’s like that thought came out of left field. Maybe I’m a little tired of myself, but Linda hasn’t ever complained. But you know, at the time, for about four or five horrible minutes, I had myself convinced it was true.
L923 +++$+++ u0 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ So you had a catastrophic thought that came out of the blue, but it might be kind of related to your own weariness with yourself. Your brain grabbed onto a convenient explanation. You’ve been tired of yourself, and so the best, ready-made explanation for Linda’s absence was the same, that she was tired of you, too.
L462 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay, Richard, I think you’re ready for some more antipanic practice. Is that okay with you?
L463 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well, uh, okay. If you think I’m ready.
L462 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I’m sure you’re ready. Our first activity is called the chair spin. It’s designed to get you feeling dizzy, which is one of the symptoms you have when your panic alarm goes off. You spin yourself till you’re dizzy, and then you can use both of the coping skills we’ve been working on to calm your body backdown. So, once you’re dizzy, do the breathing and the rational thinking exercise.
L463 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Okay. What should I say to myself for the rational thinking?
L462 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Remember what we talked about last week? You had some great rebuttals for your overestimations and catastrophizing. For today, the main thing is to quickly identify whatever automatic thought comes into your mind and replace it with one of those two rebuttals.
L463 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I can’t remember them very clearly.
L462 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay, good. I’m glad you mentioned that. I’ve got them here in my notes. [Therapist pages through file for about 15 seconds.] Okay. Here they are. When you feel your body’s alarm going off, you suggested saying to yourself, “This is my false alarm. I can get my body back to normal with some deep breathing.” And for the thoughts about having a heart attack, you suggested,“I have proof from my doctor that my heart is in great shape.” Remember?
L463 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Yeah. Right. I’ve got it.
L462 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ For today, let’s write those thoughts out on a piece of paper and you can say them out loud while you do your breathing, okay?
L463 +++$+++ u1 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Yeah. Good idea. That way I don’t have to suffer from brain lock like I do sometimes.
L779 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don’t know why. I went backwards this week. I’m just a basket case. I guess this stuff works fine for most people, but it’s looking like I’m weaker than most people.
L458 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay, Richard, you had a relapse. That’s the reality. But I also hear you coming up with a fictional explanation for your relapse. I know we’ve been working hard on the breathing and dealing with your automatic overestimations and catastrophizing, and so I’m pretty sure you can figure this out. What type of thought is this explanation—that you’re too weak a person to be successful—you have for your relapse?
L779 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Geeze. You mean this is just another one of those crazy thoughts?
L458 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Right. So you had a relapse. Now you need an explanation. Unfortunately, your explanation doesn’t hold water. You’re not a weak person. You’ve been dealing with this stuff like a hero. You’ve kept going to work; you’ve shown me more self-discipline than most people who walk through this door. Let’s toss your weakness theory and come up with a better explanation.
L779 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I, uh. I don’t know what else could it be.
L458 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What did we talk about for about 15 minutes last week?
L779 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ [20 seconds of silence.] Um. Yeah, I think we talked about me stopping therapy in a few weeks.
L458 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Right. That’s a much better explanation. So what you’re telling me with these two panic attacks is that we need to deal with the end of your counseling slowly and carefully because your thoughts of ending counseling are serving as a trigger for your false alarm system. The other thing it reminds me of is your tendency to quickly think that Linda will abandon you forever for one reason or another. Let’s take a look at another trigger for your panics that we haven’t really focused on much yet. Those automatic thoughts you have about Linda and the ones you just had about being weak seem to be what we call weakness or “defect thoughts.” Somewhere inside, you think you’re weak and defective, and so when something goes wrong, you’ve got this instant explanation. Unfortunately, your explanation makes things worse.
L779 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Do you really think it’s possible for me to overcome this?
L458 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I’ll answer that, but first, how about if you look at the evidence and tell me what you think? What do you think your chances of recovery are?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ It’s been a great week. I’m feeling more like the old me all the time.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What do you think is helping the most?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I think it’s mostly two things. The breathing and the no caffeine rule. Oh yeah, those new thoughts work pretty well too. If I can just get myself to check my automatic thoughts at the door, then I’ve got a much better chance of staying calm.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Remember last week we talked about how your automatic thoughts about losing Linda and about feeling defective might be related to the panic you had after we talked about ending therapy?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Yeah. That was interesting.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Okay. Well, today I think we should take the bull by the horns and face the possibility of your losing Linda. We can do this in your imagination, with mental imagery.
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  I don’t even like to think about that.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Remember when we talked about avoidance when we first started counseling together? What do you think avoiding the thought of losing Linda does for you?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Yeah, yeah, I know. You can’t conquer your fears without facing them. How many times have you told me that?
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hmm. Obviously, enough that you remember, which demonstrates the fact that you’re smart and tough and willing to face things that are very hard.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Okay, before we do this imagination activity, let’s talk about the automatic thoughts that pop into your head along with thoughts that Linda might leave. What else do you think at the same time?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Well, typically it’s something about me being too much of a burden and so she’s tired of me and wants to get away.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How long have you had these thoughts?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Well, we’ve been married thirty years.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So, for thirty years you’ve been thinking she’ll get tired of you, but she still hasn’t.
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  But then I think if she spends time away from me, then she’ll realize what a big hassle I am to be married to.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So if you’re with her too much, she’ll get tired of you, but if you’re away from her, she’ll probably rL738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ealize that being around you is a pain. Have I got that right?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Sounds pretty crazy, huh?
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh, it’s not crazy, it’s just not helpful. It’s sort of like your panic false alarms. It’s natural to feel insecure, everybody does sometimes, but when you get insecure, you compound it by thinking about how worthless you are to be around. What else could you think instead?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  I could remind myself that I’m really a pretty good-looking chap!
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Great. Very nice, and what else makes you a good relationship partner?
L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  I’ve got a steady job. I’m pretty thoughtful—I’ve never forgotten our anniversary or her birthday.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Excellent.
L91 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I’ve been afraid that when I report to my new job on Monday, people will think I can’t do the work.
L92 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What does that tell you about the assumptions that you are making?
L91 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Like I’m mind reading, like I know in advance what’s going to happen.
L92 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ And what assumptions are you making?
L91 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That I know what my new colleagues will think of me.
L781 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  I’m a real loser. Everything I do shows that I’m a real loser.
L780 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You say that you’re a loser. What does it mean to be a loser?
L781 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  To never get what you want, to lose at everything.
L780 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What is it that you lose at?
L781 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++  Well, I don’t exactly lose at very much.
L780 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Then perhaps you can tell me what you do lose at, because I’m having difficulty understanding how you are a loser.
L557 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Everyone at work is smarter than me.
L558 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Everyone? Every single person at work is smarter than you?
L557 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, maybe not. There are a lot of people at work I don’t know well at all. But my boss seems smarter; she seems to really know what’s going on.
L558 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Notice how we went from everyone at work being smarter than you to just your boss.
L557 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess it is just my boss. She’s had a lot of experience in my field and seems to know just what to do.
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ If it hadn’t been for me, my girlfriend wouldn’t have left me.
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Often when there is a problem in a relationship, both people contribute to it. Let’s see if it is all your fault, or if Beatrice may also have played a role in this.
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ If I don’t make dean’s list this semester, things will be over for me. I’ll be a mess; I’ll never get into law school.
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And if you don’t make dean’s list, what would happen?
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Well, it would be terrible, I don’t know what I would do.
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Well, what would happen if you didn’t make dean’s list?
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I guess it would depend on what my grades would be. There’s a big difference between getting all B’s and not making dean’s list and getting all C’s.
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And if you got all B’s?
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I guess it wouldn’t be so bad, I could do better the next semester.
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And if you got all C’s?
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ That’s really not likely, I’m doing much better in my classes. It might hurt my chances for law school, but I might be able to recover.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ How are you feeling today? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Pretty depressed.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You seem depressed.  What have you been thinking about? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ My life seems wasted at this point.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What do you mean by “wasted”? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It seems like nothing matters anymore.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ “Nothing.”  ... (long pause) Can you think of anything that does matter? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ (long pause) Curt is important, I guess.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You only “guess”? (reflection/question)
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Okay, Curt really is important.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What else is important to you? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess my friends are still important to me.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What makes your friends important to you? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ They really seem to care about me.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ When you consider your importance to Curt and your friends, what thoughts do you have? 
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, I guess my life isn’t completely wasted.
L853 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ And how do you feel when you think your life is not wasted?
L852 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Somewhat less upset.
L1000 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  You told me a few minutes ago that your life was wasted. What is your evidence for this belief? (question #1)
L999 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++  I don’t have any evidence. I just feel that way.
L1000 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  You “just feel that way.”  How else could you look at the situation?
L999 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++  I guess my life isn’t wasted if I’m still important to Curt.
L1000 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  If, in fact, you weren’t important to Curt, what would the implications be? 
L999 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++  I guess it might be tolerable if my friends didn’t abandon me.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  How long have you been checking the power sockets at work?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ About three years.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Have you ever discovered that you forgot to switch them off?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No. I go around systematically and switch them off. But that doesn’t stop me driving back to work to check.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  So even though you have many experiences telling you that your doubting thoughts are not true, you still believe that they are. What makes you believe that?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I don’t know. Perhaps I haven’t switched them off properly.
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ When you check is there any evidence for that?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Yet you continue to check and continue to have a problem. So how helpful is your checking in overcoming your problem?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Obviously it’s not helping at all.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  So why don’t you stop checking?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’d be too uncomfortable. I would ruin my weekend.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  What do you mean by uncomfortable?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’d be dwelling on the possibility that I’d not turn things off.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  So you’d still be responding as if your thoughts were true. What if you responded to your thoughts differently, could that help?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, I already tell myself that it’s stupid to think these things.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  Does that stop you dwelling on the thought?
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No. I go through my switching off routine in my head to see if I can remember all of it.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  So you’re still acting as if your thought is true. It sounds as if it might cause its own problems.
L996 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Sometimes it makes me feel better, but if I can’t clearly remember switching off some of the appliances, it means I’ll feel worse and I’ll end up checking.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  So how useful is your behavioural or mental checking in the long run? I can see it probably doesn’t help. But I’d feel worse if I didn’t check.
L997 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++  OK. We can explore that possibility in a minute. But I think we should do something about your strategies for dealing with your thoughts. It sounds as if your checking may be generating more doubts and keeping your problem going.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Bill, you now seem less dead set in believing that nothing is as much fun as getting high.
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’m not sure what to believe now.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, I still think that getting high with my friends was lots of fun, but maybe it wasn’t the perfect high I made it out to be.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Bill, what else could you have done with your friends that would have been fun?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, I don’t know about these guys, but with other friends in the past I could have gone to a baseball game, or played racquetball, or done something like sports or something.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What else?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess there are lots of things ... but none seems as exciting as doing cocaine.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Let’s try to think of some more things. What gave you the biggest thrill before you began using cocaine?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, I was an adventurous guy. When I was much younger I would go camping and hiking and rock climbing, but I’m in no shape for that now.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What do you mean when you say “I am in no shape for that”?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess I’m just skeptical that I would enjoy that kind of thing anymore. It’s just been so long since I last did it.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What would it take for you to try doing those things again?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess I’d just have to do them.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What were some of the feelings you had in the past when you would go camping or hiking or climbing?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I felt great ... really alive!
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ How did that feeling compare to the cocaine high?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ (pause) ... I guess, in some ways it was better.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, I really earned the high I got from those activities. There were no short cuts then. It was a super feeling.
L1018 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ So perhaps you now have a control belief to replace the old addictive belief. “I can experience a super high without using cocaine.”
L1017 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yes, I just need to remember that thought.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ What would be a typically difficult situation for you?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It could be almost any situation at home, really ...
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Such as ... ?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This morning, for example, I noticed that my wife, when about to breastfeed our daughter, first put aside some of my clothes lying on the bed. Just seeing her touch those clothes made all these horrible thoughts and images turn up for me. It’s incredible!
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ And that would be typical? In many different situations?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes, almost all the time. I just see all these horrible things that can happen to my daughter.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Like a warning?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ So when you get these warnings about all the horrible things that could happen to your daughter, what do you do?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, it depends on the situation. Today I asked my wife to wash her hands so as not to contaminate our daughter. I do all kinds of things to protect her. Wash clothes, avoid going into certain places in the garden, keep the windows closed, ask my wife to do the same things, etc., etc. I know it is weird, but I just can’t stop it.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Would it be correct to say that when you get these warnings, you follow along?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes, sure, yes.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ And where does that take you?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, I get a bit less tense I guess. It feels like I am protecting my daughter. I could not stand anything happening to her! That would be horrible!
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ So, some relief in the moment. And in the end, where does that take you?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nowhere, really. But what can I do? If she comes into contact with this pesticide, who knows what that could do to her in the long run? All these reports about pesticides and cancer ...
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Hmm, so you just got a warning, here and now? Did I get that right?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, I guess ...
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ And then you would typically do what?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Try to do something about it, of course. Or find out what to do.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ A warning about horrible things and then you follow along ... ?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes.
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ And that takes you where? How is the situation in your family, with your wife and daughter?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It is not good. I don’t really dare to do anything with my daughter and with my wife ... Well, we just end up in fruitless discussions. It all takes me nowhere ...
L738 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ And what about the warnings, all the scary thoughts? Do they decrease over time as you “follow along”?
L737 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, not really. I just feel more and more tense, more and more afraid ...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ As you recall this, can you get a sense of how that felt, right now, as you are describing it?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yes, a bit I guess. It feels heavy, here (moving his right hand to his chest). Not so bad now, but a bit.
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Would it be okay to allow that to stay for a while, so that we can look at it, a bit closer?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Uhh, it feels bad ... I’ve had enough of that already ...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Yeah, I get that. But would you be willing to try staying with it for sometime if that could be of help to you?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Okay, I’ll give it a go ...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Is it there, in your chest?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah ...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Would you say you sense this only in your chest or in other parts of your body as well?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Well, mostly there but also in my neck, actually.
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ What about other parts? Nothing in your legs?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ When you ask, some of it in my thighs also. I did not notice that at first. But it’s mostly in my chest.
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ The heaviness ... If it had a color, what color would that be?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Dark brown.
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Now I’m going to ask you to do something with that dark brown heaviness. It might sound a bit weird, but see if you can try it out. I would like you to gather all this dark brown heaviness together with your hands and sort of hold it out in front of you, or maybe put in on your lap. Can you see yourself doing that?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Well that’s kind of tricky ...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, just use your imagination ... Can you see it out there?
L262 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yes, I guess, in a way ...
L263 +++$+++ u8 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MISS PERKY +++$+++ If you look at it, besides being dark brown, what else does it look like?
L933 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ It just feels awful, it tears me up.
L932 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ So there is this tearing awfulness ... And right now, who is watching that?
L933 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, it is me ...
L932 +++$+++ u10 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ So there is the awfulness and it is you who is able to watch it?
L933 +++$+++ u11 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, it is somehow weird but I can see that.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ If this story of your background and the different effects it has had on your life were a book, what would be the title?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Hmm ... I don’t know. Something about the fact that so much has happened to me during which I did not get a fair chance.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ Yeah, “The boy that did not get a fair chance.” How does that sound?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Sad, but yes, it fits. It’s always with me.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ It is always with you. And who is the one reading the book?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It’s me, yeah.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ And right now, here, can you sense the sadness that comes with “The boy that did not get a fair chance”?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yes, I sense it in my whole body, especially here (makes a move with his left hand over his neck and looks down).
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ Can you focus on that sense over your shoulders, just watching the sadness there? Let me know when you get it.
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I am. It is hard to feel that, it is heavy.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ See if you can just watch it ... (silence ...) Can you move your attention to some other part of your body where you can sense that sadness?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yes, in my throat.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ Just watch the sensation and then tell me what it looks like.
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It is like a small ball ...
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ Can you notice yourself watching that small ball?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ So who is it, noticing the ball in the throat and the heaviness over the shoulders?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It is me doing that.
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ And now, can you go back, noticing again the title of the book and all the sadness with it and see what you typically do when feeling this sadness?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I don’t like it. I sort of give up, I guess. Run off, in a way ... You know ...
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ I have a thought here, let me tell you what it is and see what you think. I would suggest that the most important problem is not the book. It is a sad, painful book, definitely. “The boy that did not get a fair chance.” And, here is my point, what if the most important problem is not the book but what you do when being reminded of the story, when feeling this sadness?
L2180 +++$+++ u23 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What do you mean?
L2181 +++$+++ u12 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ALONSO +++$+++ That the book, or the story in it, easily becomes a script, telling you to act in accordance with this sad story. I think this is a very common thing in life; our past ends up being a script we follow, one way or another. Like you just said: when experiencing this you easily give up, you easily “run off” ...
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ So, if we assume that you, now, could do something outside of this story, what would be important to do?
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What do you mean, I am not sure what you are getting at ... ?
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ You have described how the book, “The boy who did not get a fair chance,” has a lot of impact on what you do in life. It sort of prescribes what you are supposed to do, right?
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that. Often it sort of comes by itself; it’s so hard to do something outside of that. The book is always with me.
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Right. So, if you could actually take steps outside of this story, even as it is present, what would those steps be about? If you where free to choose, if it was up to you? What would be important enough for you to go for?
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Okay, I see what you are asking ... Well, at work it would be for accomplishing something more, for showing both myself and others that I can contribute. That I belong in the game, or something. Being a teacher is doing something for and together with others, my students, my colleagues. I want to be more a part of that. Then with finding a partner, I don’t know ... That seems further away ...
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Yeah, and still I wonder ... just imagining that you would even take steps in that direction, not saying that you have to, but just exploring what would be there that really matters to you?
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Just having a partner, I guess ...
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Is that really so? I mean, I am pretty sure you do not want a partner who abuses you or treats you badly. So, I would guess it is about something more, something further than just a partner. Or am I mistaken here?
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No, of course, you are right. It would be about being together, belonging together. Interacting in some positive way.
L2025 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ So that sounds a bit like what you are saying about work, actually, about belonging, contributing ... ?
L2024 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Yes, exactly! Belonging in the game, as I said ...
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ So, what would be acting in accordance with the partner you want to be, even in the presence of these “warnings”? Rather than just “following along?”
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Well, not checking everything out all the time, letting go of some of the things I do when acting on these warnings.
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Like ... ?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Like avoiding the backyard, washing her clothes over and over, controlling my wife and what she does, the way I do now.
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ And if you would stop this “following along” with the warnings that turn up, what would you do that would be in accordance with the partner you want to be?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ I would spend more time partaking in the care of my daughter, I guess. And also take care of some other things that need to be done at home and which have been sort of left behind lately, because of my preoccupation with this pesticide thing.
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Okay, what could you do along those lines until our next appointment?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ I could take care of my daughter for short periods of time during the evening, both to be with her and to give my wife some time for herself. She really needs some rest.
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ So that would be like the father you want to be and actually also the partner you want to be?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Yes, exactly.
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Could you just imagine yourself sitting at home, having your daughter on your lap? Maybe you can close your eyes, if that helps you to see it more clearly. Tell me when you can see it.
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ I can see that, sitting in my favourite chair in our living room ... But it is really scary. What if the chair is contaminated? I have been sitting there with unwashed clothes. I feel really anxious!
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ A warning right? Where do you feel that feeling now?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ In my chest, as I told you earlier.
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ I want you to notice that anxious feeling in your chest and the thoughts of contamination that turn up. And, at the same time, to watch your daughter on your lap. See if you can contact her as the father you want to be.
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Yes, I am doing that. She moves her head and looks at me ... She is so sweet!
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ How does it feel to interact with her in that way?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ Fantastic! I am so proud!
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Okay. Let yourself experience that. And see if you can also watch yourself sitting there, watching your sweet daughter and having that feeling of being proud. (silence ...) And the anxiety?
L2523 +++$+++ u13 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ AROJAZ +++$+++ It is still there, I guess. Less, and still there. But my daughter is so much more important!
L2524 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ What if something like this could actually take place? What would you say?
